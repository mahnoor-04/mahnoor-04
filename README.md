<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I'm Mahnoor, when I'm not annoying my brothers I'm annoying my mom. On a good day you may find me thinking about working... On a bad day, I'd be working.</p>
<p>Anyway, when life starts life-ing you usually find yourself frustrated and broken - basically.</p>
<p>Around this time it helps to pick up a new hobby... like coding... which will also probably make life easier... in the future</p>
<p>#LazyPersonTips</p>
<p>Okay time to pick up another topic.</p>
<p>My dad quit his job to start his own business and life is life-ing... its going pretty well now though so if you need to be reminded: Life always gets better</p>
<p>If you ever see this... go check his work out at <a href="https://www.fractalmetrics.co/">FractalMetrics</a></p>
<h4>Thanks</h4>
